                <h3>Batch Distillation Column</h3>
                <p>
                    Distillation is a process used to separate a mixed fluid stream 
			into its components based on their boiling points. The process
			is an equilibrium process between a liquid flowing down the column
			and a vapor traveling up the column. The intent of distillation is
			to recover one or more pure product streams from the incoming mixed
			fluid stream. Oil and gas, consumer products, chemicals, and
			pharmaceutical industries all use distillation to create and purify 
                        products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose behind the MPEDD distillation column is to demonstrate
			fluid flow within a column, and separate an initial feed of water
			and acetic acid. The column is a batch column; there is an initial
			charge pot that will be filled once per use with four equilibrium
			trays. The top of the column has a condensing unit leading to a valve
			that provides reflux to the column and sampling of the distillate
			stream. To show the change in the distillate product we have an 
			pH indicator that will change color as our product becomes a 
			purer water stream.

                <h3>Cooling Tower</h3>
                <p>
                    Cooling towers are commonly used in industrial processes. A stream of
			hot water travels down the column while an air stream travels upwards, 
			causing evaporative cooling. Packing is used in a cooling tower to 
			increase the contact surface area between the water and air streams.
			Cooling towers are typically open systems and lose a small percentage of
			water in the form of vapor; this vapor cloud is commonly mistaken for
			smoke coming out of a stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the MPEDD cooling tower is to demonstrate the effects of 
			different types of packing, and show the cooling we achieve in our 
			column. Our column consists of tank of water that is pumped to a 
			water heater and then to the top of the column. There is a fan that
			sits on the top of the tank that pushes air up the column. We have 
			ping pong balls and packing material that have different
			surface areas to demonstrate the effect that surface area has on cooling.
                        We are improving our methods for measuring temperature along the column.

                <h3>Plug Flow Reactor</h3>
                <p>
                    Plug flow reactors are a type of continuous reactor. Reactants are mixed at 
			the reactor inlet and travel down the reactor as a plug. The further the
			length down the reactor, the higher the conversion of reactants. Plug flow reactors can be used for both gas and liquid systems.
			Some industrial uses include gasoline production and bioreactors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of MPEDD plug flow reactor is to demonstrate with a clock iodine 
                    reaction how the reactants will change along the length of the glass tube. From 
                    each reactant tank there is a one way flow needle valve that controls how fast the 
                    reactants flow through the reaction tube. This in turn changes the position of 
                    where in the tube the reaction takes place. The plug flow reactor is currently
                    in the building and testing phase.
